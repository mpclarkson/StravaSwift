This is a Swift wrapper for the [Strava v3 API](https://strava.github.io/api/).

As this is a passion project, I only work on it when I have time. So, if you are interested in contributing, feel free to submit PRs.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

[StravaSwift](https://github.com/mpclarkson/StravaSwift) is available through the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) and [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).

### Swift Package Manager

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/mpclarkson/StravaSwift.git", from: "1.0.1")
]
```

### Cocoapods

To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "StravaSwift", '~> 1.0.1'
```

## Quick Start

The full library documentation is available [here](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/StravaSwift).

### Authorize

1. [Register your app](http://labs.strava.com/developers/) with Strava and get an OAuth `client id` and `client secret`.

2. Register your redirect URL scheme in your `info.plist` file.
    
    The authentication will use the Strava app be default if it is installed on the device. If the user does not have Strava installed, it will fallback on `SFAuthenticationSession` or `ASWebAuthenticationSession` depending on the iOS version. If your app is linked on or after iOS 9.0, you must add `strava` in you appâ€™s `info.plist` file. It should be added as an entry fo the array under the `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` key. Failure to do this will result in a crash when calling `canOpenUrl:`.

    ```xml
    <key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>strava</string>
    </array>
    ```

3. Implement the following method in your `AppDelegate.swift` to handle the OAuth redirection from Strava:

    > **_NOTE:_** by default the OAuth token is only available while the app is running, which means you need to request a new token. You can implement custom token storage and retrieval behaviour by overriding the default token `delegate` in the `StravaConfig` initializer which must implement the `TokenDelegate` protocol.

    **UIKit**
    Initialize the Strava Client as follows, preferably in your `AppDelegate.swift` to ensure it is configured before you call it:

    ```swift
    let config = StravaConfig(
      clientId: YourStravaClientId,
      clientSecret: YourStravaClientSecret,
      redirectUri: YourRedirectUrl
    )

    let strava = StravaClient.sharedInstance.initWithConfig(config)

    func application(_ app: UIApplication,
                     open url: URL,
                     options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
      return strava.handleAuthorizationRedirect(url)
    }
    ```

    **SwiftUI**
    ```swift
    @main
    struct MyApplication: App {

    var strava = StravaClient.sharedInstance.initWithConfig(StravaConfig(
        clientId: YourStravaClientId,
        clientSecret: YourStravaClientSecret,
        redirectUri: YourRedirectUrl
    ))

    var body: some Scene {
      WindowGroup {
        ContentView()
          .onOpenURL { url in
            strava.handleAuthorizationRedirect(url)
          }
      }
    }
    }
    ```

6. After authorizing, you can start requesting resources:

    ```swift
    strava.authorize() { result in
      switch result {
          case .success(let token):
              //do something for success
          case .failure(let error):
              //do something for error
      }
    }
    ```

### Requesting Resources

> The Router implementation is based on this
Alamofire [example](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire#api-parameter-abstraction):

```swift
strava.request(Router.athletes(id: 9999999999)) { (athlete: Athlete?) in
    //do something with the athlete
}

let params = [
    'page' = 2,
    'per_page' = 25
]

strava.request(Router.athleteActivities(params: params) { (activities: [Activity]?) in
   //do something with the activities
}
```
